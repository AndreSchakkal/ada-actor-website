# Resources

## Datatsets
- [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas//): The CMU Movie Summary Corpus is a comprehensive dataset providing information about movies, including box office revenue, genre, release date, runtime, language, actors, and plot summaries.

- [IMDb Movies Dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/): The IMDb Movies Dataset is a valuable resource for incorporating IMDb ratings into our analysis. It also helps enhance our dataset by filling in missing information not covered by the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.

- [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download&select=movies_metadata.csv) : The Movies Dataset is another dataset containing information about movies. We leverage this dataset to supplement our analysis with additional data that may be absent from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.


- [Mojo Movie](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kalilurrahman/top-box-office-revenue-data-english-movies/data?select=boxofficemojoustop1000.tsv) : The Mojo Movie dataset provides information on top box office revenue for English movies. It complements our analysis by filling potential gaps in the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.


- [Global Database of Inflation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/inflation-database): The Global Database of Inflation is a dataset containing information on world inflation. We use it to normalize movie revenues, ensuring a consistent monetary scale over the years.



## APIs
- [Knowledge Graph API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph?hl=fr) We utilize the Knowledge Graph API as a replacement for the deprecated Freebase API. This helps us map Freebase IDs of ethnicities to their corresponding names.


## Webpages
- [List of African-American actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_actors), [List of Hispanic and Latino American actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hispanic_and_Latino_American_actors), and [List of Italian-American actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Italian-American_actors): Wikipedia pages we use to supplement our analysis with additional actors' ethnicities that may be absent from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.
