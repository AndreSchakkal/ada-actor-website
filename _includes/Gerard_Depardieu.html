  <div class="bubble">
    Very controversial these days, Gérard Depardieu's career has witnessed significant fluctuations. He experienced a notable rise in recognition during the late 1970s and 1980s. However, the early 1990s saw a setback due to a controversial interview, impacting his image in the American market. Despite this, his involvement in movies such as "Astérix et Obélix contre César" (1999) and "102 Dalmatiens" (2000) led to a resurgence in his recognition coefficient, surpassing previous levels.
