  <span class="actor-name">Mel Gibson</span>
  <div class="bubble">
    Mel Gibson's recognition coefficient surged following his film debut in "Mad Max" (1979). The success of this movie, along with subsequent roles in films like "Gallipoli" (1981) and "Mad Max 2" (1982), significantly bolstered his fame. Notably, the release of "Lethal Weapon" (1987) further elevated his recognition. However, the early 2000s witnessed a potential decline in his recognition coefficient. This decline can be attributed to his brief pause from acting and a shift towards directing. It's worth noting that the recognition coefficient focuses solely on his acting career, not accounting for his recognition as a director, which might explain the observed decrease.
