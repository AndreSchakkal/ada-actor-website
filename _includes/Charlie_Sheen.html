  <span class="actor-name">Charlie Sheen</span>
  <div class="bubble">Charlie Sheen's recognition coefficient reflects a dynamic career marked by early success in the 1980s and 1990s with notable film roles such as "Platoon" and "Major League." However, a significant decline in recognition begins around 2006, coinciding with personal challenges, including substance abuse issues, legal troubles, a highly publicized divorce, and failure to participate in high-profile roles. The controversial exit from "Two and a Half Men" in 2011 and subsequent public fallout further contributed to a negative shift in public perception. Although Sheen attempted a television comeback with "Anger Management," the recognition coefficient continued to decrease, reflecting the challenges in reestablishing his public image. The data suggests that both personal and professional factors played a role in the fluctuations, ultimately contributing to a decline in Charlie Sheen's overall recognition from 2006 onwards.
