  <div class="bubble">
    The Recognition Coefficient of Sean Connery experiences a remarkable ascent with the advent of James Bond in "Dr. No" (1962), catapulting him to global icon status and marking the inception of the Bond Era, which persists until "Never Say Never Again" in 1983. This period represents the first plateau of recognition in his career. Post-Bond, Connery distances himself from the iconic character, and sees a notable surge in recognition driven by successes like "The Untouchables" (1987) and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (1989). This success propels him into the second phase of his career, marked by a higher plateau of recognition. However, starting 2000, his participation in less successful films leads to a gradual decline in the Fame/Recognition Coefficient. Sean Connery ultimately concludes his illustrious career with a retirement in 2006.
