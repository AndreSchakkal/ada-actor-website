    Elizabeth Taylor's an interesting example since it shows a decline of Recognition not caused by death. During the late 1950s, critical acclaim for roles in "Giant" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" propelled her recognition to new heights. The early 1960s brought monumental fame with "Cleopatra" and a high-profile romance with Richard Burton. Their collaborations, including "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" in 1966, garnered critical acclaim and awards. However, the late 1960s marked a decline, attributed to industry changes, public scrutiny of Taylor's personal life, her divorce from Burton, evident in the decline during the late 1970s.
